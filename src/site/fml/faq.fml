    <question>maven-stage-plugin:stage versus wagon-maven-plugin:merge-maven-repos</question>
    <answer>
      <br/>
      Both are used to merge artifacts from one Maven repository to another with following differences;
      <ul>
        <li><i>merge-maven-repos</i> is more generic and therefore supports more protocols. </li>
        <li><i>merge-maven-repos</i> supports both normal upload and "optimize" upload where
          files are compressed into an archive which are then transferred, uncompressed and
          removed remotely. Wagon scp, scpexe, and sftp are known to support remote execution
          and therefore suitable for this type of optimization.</li>
